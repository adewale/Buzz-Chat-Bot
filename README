This is an experimental jaiku-style chat bot for Google Buzz.
If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.

What does it do?
At the moment it lets you ask for:
/help : get help
/track [some search term] : which will send you notifications of matching Buzz posts. 
*WARNING: untrack is not currently implemented*


TESTS
====
The tests required Nose and NoseGae.
They can be run like this:
nosetests --with-gae tracker_tests.py

Although I prefer to do something like this:
nosetests --with-gae *test*py
