This is an experimental jaiku-style chat bot for Google Buzz.
If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.

What does it do?
================
At the moment it lets you ask for:
/help Prints out this message
/track [search term] Starts tracking the given search term and returns the id for your subscription
/untrack [id] Removes your subscription for that id
/list Lists all search terms and ids currently being tracked by you
/about Tells you which instance of the Buzz Chat Bot you are using
/post [some message] Posts that message to Buzz


What does it require?
=====================
App Engine
Python


Tests
=====
To run the tests you need gae-testbed, nose and nose-gae. So...
sudo easy_install gaetestbed
sudo easy_install nose
sudo easy_install nosegae

They can be run like this:
nosetests --with-gae tracker_tests.py

Although I prefer to do something like this:
nosetests --with-gae *test*py


INSTALLATION
This isn't yet ready for installation by people who don't feel like changing the Python code. However if you feel brave you should:
- Register an AppEngine application at http://appengine.google.com/start/createapp?
- Change the app.yaml file to have the same Application Identifier as your application.
- Take a look at settings.py
-- Change the settings.APP_NAME constant to have the same Application Identifier as your application.
-- Change the settings.SECRET_TOKEN from the default
- Use the Google App Engine Launcher: http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python to deploy the application.
