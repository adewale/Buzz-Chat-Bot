Buzz Chat Bot
============
Register the app so that people don't have to trust anonymous
When someone adds the bot to their roster, send them a link to the app's website so that they can do the oauth dance
Profile page should show the email address of the current user.
Verify that phrase search works and add tests for it 
Update the PRD - describing this bot
Work out how to handle location-based Track and complex searches. Perhaps using the web interface?
Use Bob Wyman's trick where /track initially does a /search and gives you the first 10 results to verify that it's worked
File a bug for language indexing in search
File a bug for search by actor.id
Allow untrack to accept a search term as well as an id
Allow for a stopword list -- useful for popular terms
Implement a 'pause' command which stops sending you messages until you issue a 'resume' command

Add the following commands
follow @user@gmail.com
unfollow @user@gmail.com
follow profiles.google.com/userid
unfollow profiles.google.com/userid
get @user@gmail.com
get profiles.google.com/userid
search "phrase containing more than one search term"
