Update the web page so that it's more informative and doesn't require you login before it tells you anything 
Update the PRD - describing this
Work out how to handle location-based Track and complex searches. Perhaps using the web interface?
Use Bob Wyman's trick where /track initially does a /search and gives you the first 10 results to verify that it's worked
File a bug for language indexing in search
File a bug for search by actor.id
When someone adds the bot to their roster, send them a link to the app's website so that they can do the oauth dance
